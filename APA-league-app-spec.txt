Scope: Build a webkit application to track the scoring of 9-ball APA pool.  Application should be accessible on iPhone, iPad, Android and web.

11. User prompted "Who won the lag?" After five seconds.  PLAYER01 and PLAYER02's profile pictures are displayed as tappable buttons.
	Set WON_LAG = User's selection (1,2)
12. User prompted "Time to break!" with a picture of a 9-ball game ready to start.
13. The player who won the lag breaks the balls on the table.
14. Scorekeeper is presented with the GAME INTERFACE.

*** GAME INTERFACE ***

During a turn, there are several outcomes.  These outcomes are slightly different on the First Turn (Break).

OUTCOMES:

A. If a "legal" ball is pocketed, the player continues his turn.  The pocketed ball is tracked as 1 point.
B. If an "illegal" ball is pocketed, the player's turn concludes.  The "illegal" ball is tracked as a dead ball.
C. If the cue ball goes in the pocket, the player has "scratched" and the turn is concluded.  The scratch is not tracked.
D. If the cue ball and a game ball goes in the pocket, the player has "scratched" and the game ball is now "dead." The "dead" ball is tracked.
E. If the player fails to hit a "legal" ball in the correct order, and no ball is pocketed, the turn is over and the other player gets "ball-in-hand." This is not tracked.
F. If the player hits a "legal" ball in the correct order, and no ball is pocketed, the turn is over.
G. If the player hits the "legal" ball, and this causes the 9-ball to be pocketed, he scores 2 points for the 9-ball and 1 point for any additional game balls.  Any balls left on the table after the 9-ball is legally pocketed are marked as dead balls.

After each of Player Two's turns, an inning is marked as progress through the game.

What do we call these Data Points?

A. [POCKETED]
B. [DEAD BALL]
C. N/A
D. [DEAD BALL]
E. N/A
F. N/A
G. [9-BALL] + [POCKETED] + [DEAD BALL]


There are 3 main actions that are tracked: [POCKETED]. [DEAD BALL] and [9-BALL].

Additionally, a player may call a [DEFENSIVE SHOT] to explain a shot that is not predicted to pocket a ball.

It is useful to track which balls have been pocketed, but not all players will wish to do so.  It must be possible to bypass ball-by-ball tracking.





Let's try an example:

PLAYER01 breaks the new rack.  It is a legal break.  The 3-ball is pocketed.

1. The scorekeeper is looking at the GAME INTERFACE.  PLAYER01's profile picture, name and team number are displayed at the top.
2. The scorekeeper selects [POCKETED].
	PLAYER01 receives 1 point.
3. Optionally, The scorekeeper is presented with all 9 balls in a grid on the screen.  The scorekeeper can tap the 3-ball to mark it as pocketed.
	If The scorekeeper does not wish to track the balls, there is a button at the top that says "Don't track balls."  If selected, the BALL TRACKER will go away and only be accessible by tapping a flag at the bottom of the screen.
4. PLAYER01's turn continues.  He attempts to pocket the 1-ball, but misses.
5. PLAYER01's turn concludes.
6. The scorekeeper pokes "TURN COMPLETE".  The interface changes to PLAYER02's picture, name and team number.

1. PLAYERTWO pockets the 1-ball.
2. The scorekeeper selects [POCKETED].
	PLAYER02 receives 1 point.
	The BALL TRACKER is displayed.  The scorekeeper taps the 1-ball.  The 3-ball and 1-ball are now greyed out.
3. PLAYER02's turn continues.  He shoots the 2-ball and uses it to knock in the 7-ball.
4. The scorekeeper selects [POCKETED].
	PLAYER02 receives 1 point.
	The BALL TRACKER is displayed.  The scorekeeper taps the 7-ball.  The 3-ball, 1-ball and 7-ball are now greyed out.
5. PLAYER02's turn continues.  He shoots for the 2-ball, but hits the 8-ball instead.  The 8-ball is pocketed.
6. The scorekeeper taps [DEAD BALL].
	DEAD_BALLS increments by 1.
	The BALL TRACKER is displayed.  The scorekeeper taps the 8-ball.  The 8-ball now shows a skull icon overlaid.  The 3-ball, 1-ball and 7-ball are greyed out.
7. PLAYER02's turn concludes.
8. The scorekeeperr taps "TURN COMPLETE".  This concludes the first inning.  An animation is displayed and the interface switches back to PLAYER01.


In this example, PLAYER01 pocketed a ball.  The scorekeeper opted to use the BALL TRACKER.  PLAYER02 pocketed two balls and one dead ball.  The score is PLAYER01: 1, PLAYER02: 2, DEAD BALLS: 1, and INNINGS: 1.


The game continues until one of the players has scored his specified number of points.

The player's SKILL LEVEL correlates to the number of points he must score to win the game.

The player's team receives GAME POINTS based on the number of points scored by the loser of the game and his skill level.


The score of each match is stored for each player.  The total number of PLAYER01 points + PLAYER02 points + DEAD BALLS for each round must equal 10.
